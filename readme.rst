Presentations by Randy Syring
#############################

I've created this quick-reference guide to easily recall the presentations I've given and the
resources associated with them.

*Note:* links to conference session pages will often die as the conference preps for the next year.  Not much I can do about that, sorry!  :)

PyTennessee 2017: Continuous Integration For The Win!
=====================================================

Learn how to increase the quality of your code and improve team productivity by leveraging a CI pipeline to run tests, lint, and measure code coverage. Then, integrate all that knowledge right into a GitHub pull request for easy team review & verification before deployment. Finally, discuss the cultural challenges that can be met by those that want to integrate CI into their team.

CodeMash 2017: Automation For The Win!
======================================

A great development workflow will make your good developers great, and your great developers exceptional and automation is a cornerstone of a great development workflow. Every task that can be done by a machine should be. Continuous Integration (CI) is the practice of testing each change done to your codebase automatically and as early as possible. Learn how to increase the quality of your code and improve team productivity by leveraging a CI pipeline to run tests, lint, and measure code coverage. Then, integrate all that knowledge right into a GitHub pull request for easy team review & verification before deployment.

Custom Software Risks & Rewards: Protecting ROI using Agile methods
===================================================================

During our Lunch & Learn, Randy Syring, Chief Executive Developer at `Level 12`_, will explore how an Agile approach is designed specifically to protect the ROI of a project and to overcome the risks associated with custom software development using a traditional (waterfall) model.

Code PaLOUsa 2016: Testing Application Boundaries
=================================================

When it comes to automated tests, testing our internal code is often the easiest. But when it comes to things like Databases, Email, Web APIs, that is, when we cross our application's outer "boundary", testing can get really difficult really fast. In this talk, we will look at best practices for automated testing around areas of our application that reach beyond it's "boundary."

Code PaLOUsa 2016: Autmoated Testing Overview & Best Practices
==============================================================

We'll cover testing best practices, ways to make team testing more effective, test centric vs test driven development, and how to get started testing when there are no tests and the code is messy. We'll use an example project to see how these ideas flush out in the real world.

PyOhio 2015: Testing the Database Layer: typical problems & best practices
==========================================================================

Learn how to increase the quality of your code and improve team productivity by leveraging a CI pipeline to run tests, lint, and measure code coverage. Then, integrate all that knowledge right into a GitHub pull request for easy team review & verification before deployment.

Pythology 101: Testing Methodology & Best Practices

PyTexas 2014: Reliable Testing & Deployments with pip and wheels
================================================================

I plan to briefly introduce pip requirements files and the wheel format. I will then demonstrate an approach for structuring requirements files, using "snapshot" requirement files, and building "wheelhouses" that get committed to your VCS.

PyTexas 2014: Dates & Time: pain points, useful libraries, and testing considerations
======================================================================================

Date & Time handling in Python has it's ups & downs. In this talk, we will cover:

* some of the pain points and weaknesses in the Python standard library
* two libraries I have found helpful: dateutils and arrow
* best practices for working with timezones
* best practices for testing code that deals with dates and time
