Flask: Beyond Hello World!
==========================

Getting started in Flask is super easy.  But what happens when your application needs more than
just the basics?  Flask's simplicity makes it easy to get started but also means you have to do
more legwork as your application's needs grow.

We will start with a typical "Hello World" Flask app and then integrate common features needed
for most modern web applications, including:

* Utilizing application factory pattern & blue prints
* Automated testing with pytest
* CLI integration with external packages and global options
* Logging
* Database integration with Flask-SQLAlchemy
* Distributed task queues for background tasks
